## Abstract:
This project presents a system for automatically detecting biased and unbiased news articles using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The system analyzes the language and tone used in news articles to classify them as biased or unbiased. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system in accurately identifying biased news sources, providing readers with a valuable tool for making informed decisions.
